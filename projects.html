                            Rashita, developed as part of the CSC343 Software Engineering course, is a theoretical system design for a medical mobile application. The app is intended to support users in managing their medications through features like medicine reminders, drug interaction checks, a pharmacy locator, and order management. This project is entirely conceptual, with no actual application implemented. It focuses on system analysis and design elements such as interaction diagrams, class diagrams, and test planning, aiming to demonstrate key software engineering principles.

                        This research project was conducted as part of the CSC304 ethical issues in computing & research methods, and focuses on the ethical implications of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems. While AI offers powerful capabilities for real time health tracking and data analysis, it also introduces serious ethical concerns related to privacy, transparency, algorithmic bias, the doctor-patient relationship, and equitable access. To explore these issues, we designed and distributed a survey targeting students in both computer science and health-related fields. The results revealed strong concerns about data misuse, reduced empathy in care, and the need for human oversight in AI decision-making. The study highlights the importance of ethical frameworks that prioritize patient privacy, informed consent, and fairness in the implementation of AI-driven healthcare systems.

                        This project was developed as part of the CSC380 – Principles of Database Concepts course. <br>
                        The main requirement was to design and implement a database system for a restaurant. We chose McDonald’s as our case study because it offers a variety of services such as party bookings and food truck requests, which allowed us to apply different database concepts in a practical way.<br>
                        We built a system called “McReserve Hub” that enables customers to make reservations and allows managers to manage operations. <br>
                        Our work included designing the ER diagram, performing relational mapping, writing SQL queries, and developing a Java-based GUI for both customer and manager interfaces. All components were documented in a comprehensive project report.
